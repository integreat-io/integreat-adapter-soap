## Getting started

### Prerequisits

Requires node v8.6 and Integreat v0.6.

### Installing and using

Install from npm:

```
npm install integreat-adapter-soap
```

Example of use:
```javascript
const integreat = require('integreat')
const greatSoap = require('integreat-adapter-soap')
const defs = require('./config')

const resources = greatSoap(integreat.resources())
const great = integreat(defs, resources)

// ... and then dispatch actions as usual
```

The `greatSoap()` function adds the adapter `soap` to the resources object, but
you still need to configure your source to use it.

Example source configuration:

```javascript
{
  id: 'store',
  adapter: 'soap',
  auth: 'soapAuth',
  baseUri: 'https://api.soapheaven.com',
  endpoints: [
    {options: {uri: '/getDocuments'}}
  ]
}
```

The `soapAuth` referenced here should be a valid auth object, relevant for this
SOAP service.

### Running the tests

The tests can be run with `npm test`.
